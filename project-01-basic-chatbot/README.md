# Project 1: Basic Chat Agent

## Purpose
This project demonstrates a fundamental chat agent using LangGraph. It's a simple, single-node graph that takes a user's message and returns a response from an AI model.

## Setup & Usage
1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Run the agent:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Business Value
This basic chatbot can be the foundation for customer service bots, internal helpdesks, or any application requiring simple, automated responses. It's a low-cost way to provide 24/7 support and answer common questions.

## Extension Ideas
*   Integrate a more powerful language model.
*   Add a memory component to the state to have a more contextual conversation.
*   Connect the chatbot to a messaging platform like Slack or Discord.

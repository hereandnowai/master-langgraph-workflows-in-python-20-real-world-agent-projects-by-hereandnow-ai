# Project 18: Report Generator

## Purpose
This project demonstrates a report generator agent that can fetch information using a search tool and then compile it into a comprehensive report using a language model. This automates the process of data gathering and summarization.

## Setup & Usage
1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Set up your Google API key and Tavily API key:**
    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key
    export TAVILY_API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```
3.  **Run the agent:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Business Value
Automated report generation can save countless hours for businesses that rely on regular data analysis and reporting. This agent can quickly produce summaries, market research, or internal reports, allowing employees to focus on strategic decision-making rather than manual data compilation.

## Extension Ideas
*   Integrate with internal databases or APIs to pull proprietary data for reports.
*   Allow users to define report templates or specific sections they want included.
*   Add a scheduling mechanism to generate reports automatically at set intervals.

# Project 10: HR Policy Helper

## Purpose
This project demonstrates how to build an HR policy helper that can answer questions about a company's policies. The agent uses a vector store to retrieve relevant information from a policy document and then uses a language model to generate an answer.

## Setup & Usage
1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Run the agent:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Business Value
HR policy helpers can provide employees with instant access to information about company policies, such as vacation, benefits, and code of conduct. This can reduce the burden on HR staff and ensure that employees have the information they need to do their jobs effectively.

## Extension Ideas
*   Use a real HR policy document instead of a dummy document.
*   Integrate with a chat platform, such as Slack or Microsoft Teams, to make the agent more accessible to employees.
*   Add a mechanism for escalating complex questions to a human HR representative.

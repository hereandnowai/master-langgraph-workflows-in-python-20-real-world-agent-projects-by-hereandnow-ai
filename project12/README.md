# Project 12: Email Parser + Responder

## Purpose
This project demonstrates how to build an email parser and responder. The agent first parses an email to extract the key information, and then it writes a response based on that information.

## Setup & Usage
1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Run the agent:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Business Value
Email automation can save a significant amount of time and effort for businesses. This agent can be used to automate customer support, sales outreach, and other email-based workflows.

## Extension Ideas
*   Integrate with a real email account to process incoming emails automatically.
*   Use a more sophisticated email parsing technique to extract structured data from emails.
*   Add a human-in-the-loop to approve or edit email responses before they are sent.

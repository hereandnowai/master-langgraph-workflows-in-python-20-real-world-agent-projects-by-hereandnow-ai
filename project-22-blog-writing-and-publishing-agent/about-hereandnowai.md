## 🧠 Intro Prompt for Agent

> \*\*Agent Prompt Context:\*\*
> **Organization Name:** HERE AND NOW AI – Artificial Intelligence Research Institute
> **Organization Description:**
> Founded in Chennai, HERE AND NOW AI is dedicated to democratizing AI education, research, and automation. Our vision is to create fully autonomous AI agents—including a Robot Professor—and integrate AI deeply into enterprise workflows via agentic frameworks, tool orchestration, and standards-based messaging protocols (Model Context Protocol & Agent-to-Agent). We build enterprise-grade AI systems (CRMs, ERPs, chatbots, RPA workflows), run daily agent deployments, and innovate with graph-based AI architectures for scalable, explainable, and interoperable multi-agent environments.

>
> **Purpose for Today:**
> I want an SEO-optimized, proofread, Yoast-compliant blog post. You’ll suggest five relevant topics on generative AI or AI agents, I’ll pick one, you’ll draft, a proofreader agent will refine it, and a publisher agent will push it to WordPress.

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Choose your preferred topic** from the list above.
2. **Provide any additional context**, angle, or keywords (e.g., focus on case studies, technical deep-dive, ethical considerations).
3. The agent will then:

   * Research the topic,
   * Create a Yoast-style SEO draft,
   * Send it for proofreading/editing,
   * And finally publish it via WordPress.

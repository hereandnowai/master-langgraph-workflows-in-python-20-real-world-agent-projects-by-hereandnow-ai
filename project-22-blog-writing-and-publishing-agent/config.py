ORGANIZATION_DESCRIPTION = """
Founded in Chennai, HERE AND NOW AI is dedicated to democratizing AI education, research, and automation. 
Our vision is to create fully autonomous AI agents—including a Robot Professor—and integrate AI deeply into 
enterprise workflows via agentic frameworks, tool orchestration, and standards-based messaging protocols 
(Model Context Protocol & Agent-to-Agent). We build enterprise-grade AI systems (CRMs, ERPs, chatbots, 
RPA workflows), run daily agent deployments, and innovate with graph-based AI architectures for scalable, 
explainable, and interoperable multi-agent environments.

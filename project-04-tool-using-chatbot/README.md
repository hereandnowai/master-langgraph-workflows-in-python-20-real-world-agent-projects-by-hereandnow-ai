# Project 4: Human-in-the-Loop

## Purpose
This project demonstrates how to incorporate a human-in-the-loop for approval or feedback. The graph will pause and wait for user input before continuing, which is critical for tasks that require human oversight.

## Setup & Usage
1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Run the agent:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The application will prompt you for input in the terminal.

## Business Value
Human-in-the-loop workflows are essential for preventing errors and ensuring quality in automated systems. This is particularly important in domains like finance (approving transactions), healthcare (verifying diagnoses), and content moderation (reviewing flagged content).

## Extension Ideas
*   Implement a more sophisticated approval mechanism using LangGraph's `interrupt` feature.
*   Build a simple web interface for the human approval step.
*   Add a timeout to the human input, so the process can continue automatically if no input is received.

# Project 8: Finance Assistant

## Purpose
This project demonstrates how to build a finance assistant that can query stock prices using a search tool. The agent can provide real-time financial data, making it a valuable tool for investors and financial analysts.

## Setup & Usage
1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Set up your Tavily API key:**
    ```bash
    export TAVILY_API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```
3.  **Run the agent:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Business Value
Financial assistants can automate routine tasks, such as checking stock prices, tracking portfolio performance, and generating financial reports. This can free up financial professionals to focus on more strategic activities, such as making investment decisions and providing financial advice.

## Extension Ideas
*   Integrate with a financial data API to get more detailed and reliable data.
*   Add more financial tools, such as a portfolio tracker or a risk analysis tool.
*   Build a user interface to visualize financial data and make it easier to interact with the agent.

# Project 11: Multi-Agent Workflow

## Purpose
This project demonstrates how to create a multi-agent workflow where two agents coordinate to complete a task. The first agent researches a topic, and the second agent writes a blog post based on the research.

## Setup & Usage
1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Run the agent:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Business Value
Multi-agent workflows can be used to automate complex tasks that require the expertise of multiple specialists. This can improve efficiency, reduce errors, and free up employees to focus on more strategic activities.

## Extension Ideas
*   Add more agents to the workflow, such as an editor or a social media manager.
*   Implement a more sophisticated coordination mechanism, such as a shared knowledge base or a message bus.
*   Use different types of agents, such as agents with different skills or personalities.

# Project 9: Marketing Generator

## Purpose
This project demonstrates how to create a marketing generator that can iteratively refine a marketing slogan. The agent uses a cycle in the graph to generate and refine slogans until a satisfactory result is achieved.

## Setup & Usage
1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Run the agent:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Business Value
Marketing generators can automate the creation of marketing copy, such as slogans, headlines, and social media posts. This can save marketers a significant amount of time and effort, and it can also help them to generate more creative and effective marketing materials.

## Extension Ideas
*   Use a more sophisticated refinement process, such as A/B testing or user feedback.
*   Generate other types of marketing copy, such as product descriptions or email newsletters.
*   Integrate with a marketing automation platform to automatically publish generated content.

# Project 14: Budget Planner

## Purpose
This project demonstrates a budget planner agent that takes CSV input, summarizes expenses by category, and then uses a language model to provide a natural language summary of the budget.

## Setup & Usage
1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Set up your Google API key:**
    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```
3.  **Run the agent:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Business Value
Automating budget analysis can help individuals and businesses quickly understand their spending patterns. This agent can provide immediate insights, making financial planning more accessible and efficient.

## Extension Ideas
*   Allow users to upload their own CSV files.
*   Add functionality to suggest budget optimizations or identify areas of overspending.
*   Integrate with financial APIs to pull transaction data directly.

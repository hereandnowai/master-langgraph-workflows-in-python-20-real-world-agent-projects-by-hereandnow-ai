# Project 6: Deferred Nodes

## Purpose
This project demonstrates how to use deferred nodes to perform map-reduce style operations in a LangGraph agent. This is useful for processing a list of items in parallel and then aggregating the results.

## Setup & Usage
1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Run the agent:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Business Value
Map-reduce is a powerful paradigm for distributed computing and data processing. In agentic workflows, it can be used to parallelize tasks, such as processing a large number of documents, images, or other data sources. This can significantly improve performance and reduce processing time.

## Extension Ideas
*   Use a more realistic data source, such as a list of files or a database query.
*   Implement a more sophisticated aggregation function, such as calculating statistics or generating a summary report.
*   Explore how to handle errors and retries in a map-reduce workflow.

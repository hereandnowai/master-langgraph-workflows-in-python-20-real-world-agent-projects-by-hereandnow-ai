# Project 5: Conditional Edges

## Purpose
This project demonstrates how to use conditional edges to create branching logic in a LangGraph agent. The agent's path through the graph can change based on the current state, allowing for more dynamic and intelligent behavior.

## Setup & Usage
1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Run the agent:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Business Value
Conditional logic is the cornerstone of any complex process. In agentic workflows, it allows for routing tasks, escalating issues, and making decisions based on data. This is essential for building robust and reliable automations in any business domain.

## Extension Ideas
*   Implement more complex conditions based on the content of the messages.
*   Create a multi-step workflow with several decision points.
*   Use conditional edges to route tasks to different agents based on their skills or availability.
